  <h2>The Story of Cody Sheffield</h2>
  <h4>A spacer from the EVE Online Universe</h4>
  <img src="images/portrait.jpg" alt="Cody Sheffield's Portrait" />
  <p>Having virtually no past, Cody Sheffield is somewhat of an enigma at best. He awoke in a cloning vat within a derelict space station over 30 years ago without any memories from his previous clone being transplanted.  Looking for a safe way to leave the station, he coincidentally ran into a mixed race crew of freelancers that were attempting to salvage parts and technology from the station. After this awkward meeting and no one having any idea what to make of his sudden appearance, they invited him to leave the station with them and start a life among them. He spent many years among them, learning a great many things of the universe he inhabits. They became the closest thing to a family that he can remember. But during an especially dangerous salvage operation within a long abandoned cruiser, a small gang fleet of Guristas Pirates started approaching and the crew abandoned him. Luckily for him, the pirates pursued. None the wiser to his presence aboard the abandoned ship.</p>
  <p>Escaping the ship within the hull of an attack drone, he made his way to the Caldari home world, where he returned among his race. He joined the Kalaakiota Corporation as a MTAC technician on one of it's industrial worlds. Having witnessed first hand the rise of Tibus Heth and the shape of things to come not only for his employer, but the entire Caldari State as well, he defected. He was largely disinterested in the financial and political squabbles of the corporations. Making his way to Federation space, he made a life for himself within the law offices of the Federation, and although uncommon of Caldari, he took a Gallentean wife. Utilizing training he gained from his employment with the Gallente Federation as well as his connections, he later financed his own business, "Federal Bounty Services", in order to promote and develop his services as a bounty hunter which he continues to this day.</p>
